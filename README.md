Sentiment classification on Amazon product reviews using NLP and machine learning.
# Amazon Product Review Sentiment Classification üì¶üí¨

This project analyzes and classifies customer reviews from Amazon to determine whether the sentiment behind each review is **positive** or **negative**. We used real product review data, performed Natural Language Processing (NLP), and trained machine learning models to make accurate predictions.

## üìä Project Overview

- **Dataset:** Amazon product review dataset (Datafiniti)
- **Goal:** Predict review sentiment (Positive = 1 / Negative = 0)
- **Approach:** NLP preprocessing + TF-IDF + ML classification
- **Models Used:** 
  - Naive Bayes ‚úÖ
  - Logistic Regression ‚úÖ
  - Confusion Matrix & ROC-AUC for evaluation

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Steps

1. **Data Cleaning & NLP**
   - Lowercasing
   - Punctuation removal
   - Tokenization
   - Stopwords removal
   - Lemmatization (TextBlob)

2. **Feature Engineering**
   - TF-IDF Vectorization

3. **Modeling**
   - Train/Test split
   - Logistic Regression with class balancing
   - Naive Bayes for baseline comparison

4. **Evaluation**
   - Classification Report (Precision, Recall, F1-score)
   - ROC-AUC Score
   - Confusion Matrix visualization
   - Sample sentence predictions

## üìà Results

- **Logistic Regression Accuracy:** ~92%
- **AUC Score:** ~0.91
- **Naive Bayes:** Lower performance due to class imbalance
- **Real sentence predictions:** Successfully predicts sentiment with high accuracy

## üß† Lessons Learned

- Logistic Regression outperforms Naive Bayes when text complexity increases
- Class balancing (`class_weight='balanced'`) is crucial for fair predictions
- TF-IDF is a powerful and simple method for vectorizing text
- Cleaning text is as important as modeling itself
